# Do You Hear What I Hear?

## Hello, my name is Colin Lechner. I am a sound designer and field recordist.

I have the time and equipment to capture and create fantastic SFX, but I don't have the financial resources to optimize my field recording expeditions.

With this campaign, my goal is to procure a minimal amount of financial support to enable me to continue to design and capture sound effects for my work in post-production sound. As a contributor you will receive compensation through single seat user licenses to the various royalty free sound effects libraries that I create throughout the year. When you contribute, you will be supporting the development of a cohesive sound community that is excited to invest in its members' work. Think of yourself as a traditional patron of the arts! Through this project, I want any artist who works with sound to be able to participate, through investment, in the creation of the sound effects that I produce. 

So right now you're asking yourself "why would I contribute to your project when I can just pick up individual SFX libraries from a boutique library site?" Well, when you contribute to my campaign you're not just buying an individual library with narrow and defined content, subject to unknown technological whims that are, unfortunately, dictated by the necessity of your purchase. Instead, you will have, in effect, hired me as a personal field recorder on retainer. Depending on your level of contribution, you can tell me what you need, and I will go and find it for you. I record at almost every opportunity I find, because I take great pride in using my own sounds, and not generic library effects, in my projects. You will also have the assurance that the sound effects that I give you will be of the highest technical standard. I use a variety of microphones to capture my SFX, but my go-to choice, in both the studio and in the field, are my Schoeps CMC Colette microphones. I use these mics in tandem with a Sound Device 633 recorder, and the resulting recordings are, quite frankly, pretty magical. 

My sound for picture editing philosophy is to find the right sound to get the job done. Sometimes layering a bunch of sounds together just doesn't cut it like a distinctive, high quality, custom effect does. This philosophy also guides my recordings. I search for elements of fantastic realism as I try to capture characterful, practical sounds for my library. I am continually searching for the fantastic nature of the mundane. 

While I do not yet have a definitive list of recordings for the upcoming year, my primary focuses will be natural BGs. I am exploring artistic residency opportunities offered by the National Park Service, that will allow me to spend weeks at a time recording deep in the wilderness. Here is a brief list of additional recordings you might expect:

* Thunder... I'm a thunder chaser.

* Big cats from various refuges

* A large collection of winds

* Natural BGs, rural BGs, urban BGs, and indoor BGs

* Single engine airplanes

* Post-production focused impulse response libraries

In addition to these subjects, much of the material I record comes as a result of vigilance. I am always listening for interesting recording opportunities and novel subject matter. As an example, there's a historic, operational, steam-powered sawmill not too far from my house that I plan to record in the near future.

Having all of these recordings at your disposal is great, but essentially useless, if you can't find the exact file you need the moment you need it. To prevent this tragedy, I edit and master every SFX I record, and then I embed detailed Soundminer metadata for every file. My typical turnover time is less than a week from capture to catalogue.

My most recent recording project has been natural backgrounds of the Pacific Northwest. Since beginning to record this collection in April, I have amassed over 6GB of edited and cataloged rainstorms, forest ambiences, and ocean waves. As of June 7, I have recorded and cataloged 114 sound effects files this year. The vast majority of these files contain multiple takes of the sound effect. Up till now, I have only been able to dedicate one day a week to recording in the field, but with your help I can increase my efforts. 

As a subscriber, you are going get a lot of high quality, useful sound effects; it's guaranteed.
